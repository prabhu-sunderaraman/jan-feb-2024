### Implement the following in Lab09.java using Stream API


* Extract and store all the distinct city names alone in a separate file called **cities.txt**
* Extract and store all the distinct country names alone in a separate file called **countries.txt**
* Print the count of all cities grouped by country. Use **Collectors.groupingBy or Collectors.partitionBy**
* Print the names of all the cities
* Generate **places.json** file with all the contents in JSON format

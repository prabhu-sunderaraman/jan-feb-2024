* Create Lab02.java in **com.herbalife** package with a main. In this lab you will practice using loops and strings

* Create a class **MyMath** with the following operations
* Use MyMath from Lab02.java 

### Part I

* Calculate the Sum of ODD numbers between 1 to 10001

### Part II

* Calculate the 'integer' average of all numbers from 1 to 10001, excluding the numbers: 10, 19, 21, 39, 309, 431, 643, 942, 1209, 7981, 8888, 9910 
* Result should be: 5003


### Part III
* You have String input like this
``` java
String input = "+5 -1 +9 +5 -67 +5 -3 +2 -4 +6 +8 -13 +2 -4 +6 +18 -3 +2 -4 +6 +88 +15 -1 +9 +5 -67 +45 -3 +2 -4 +36 +8 -13 +2 -4 +6 +18 -3 +2 -74 +11 +109";
```

* Compute the value by parsing the input 

### Part IV

* You have String input like this
``` java
String input = "";
```
* Start a loop for count 5
* On each iteration accept a word as input from the user using **Scanner**
* Append the word to the input
* Do not allow input of a word that already exists; ie., don't allow duplication
* Finally print all the words in upper case

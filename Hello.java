//Java is case sensitive
//Every statement needs to be terminated by a semicolon
//Java's syntax is very similar to C/C++
public class Hello { //Name of the class should be same as name of the file
	public static void main(String[] args) { //Starting point is the main method
		System.out.println("Hello Java"); //Console.WriteLine("") in C#
	}
